1. Initial Access & Authentication
   
Landing Page: The process begins at the portal's entry screen, which describes the platform as an AI-driven system for credit evaluation and risk assessment.
Login/Registration: Users must proceed to a secure login page where they enter their username and password to access the system. There is also an option for new users to create an account.

2. Data Entry & Application
   
Loan Application Form: Users are required to fill out a comprehensive application form with various details, including:
Personal Information: Gender, marital status, number of dependents, and education level.
Financial Details: Employment status (self-employed or not), applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, and loan term in months.
Credit/Property Info: Credit history and the property area (e.g., Rural, Semiurban, Urban).
Validation: The system ensures all fields are filled before allowing the user to proceed.

3. Document Verification
   
Identity Check: After the application is submitted, the user moves to the Aadhaar Verification step.
File Upload: The user must choose and upload their Aadhaar card (e.g., a PDF file) for verification.

Loan Status: Shows if the loan is "Approved" or "Rejected".
Confidence & Accuracy: Displays a prediction confidence score (e.g., 75.05%) and model accuracy (e.g., 86%).
Visual Data: Provides charts comparing income vs. loan amount and an "Approval Probability" gauge.
Reporting: Users can download a detailed Loan Eligibility Prediction Report that summarizes their application data and provides model explainability via SHAP values.

5. Post-Evaluation Features
